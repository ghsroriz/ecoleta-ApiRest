### Ecoleta
>The main objective of this site it's to collect and register any point for collect biodegradable materials. Anyone who own's for example a market can register your's location as a point of collection of this materials. The website cotains a map where you can show exactly where is your business location. Than you tell us your name, e-mail, WhatsApp number, city and state. After all this information you will submit >us your data and a image of the local and that's it, now you are registered in our data base as a collection point.

### API

>This API was devoleped using _Typescript_, importing some libraries like **_knex_** for data base connection and Queries execution and express for controllers. It's objective is to make inserts of any coming data from anyone who wants to register your's business as a point of collection. So we used _Sqlite3_ as a data base manager, generate 3 tables "items", "points" and "item-points" for storage all this data.
>We constructed routes for controllers and for accessing images(very important on the front), and i learned how to work correctly with _Typescript_, literaly i've grown up with all this knowledge and this is what i want to do with my career. 
>Further more i'll work more on this project in order to let any one throw you business image on the screen and upload it to my server,
i've have to develop a thank's screen, and keep modifying as a traning for other big projects.

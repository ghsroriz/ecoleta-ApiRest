# Ecoleta ApiRestful

>This API was developet at Rocketseat's bootcamp.
>First of all this application was devoloped for learning more about web development and acquiring experience, knowledge and skills in _Javascript_, _Typescript_. Also i've developed a front-end using _Typescript_ and _React_, and you can find all this on this [link](https://github.com/ghsroriz/ecoleta-React-Rocketseat).

### Ecoleta
>The main objective of this site it's to collect and register any point for collect biodegradable materials. Anyone who own's for example a market can register their businnes location as a point of collection of this materials. The website cotains a map where you can show exactly where is your business location. Than you tell us the name, e-mail, WhatsApp number, city and state. After all this  you will submit us your data and a image of the building and that's it, now you are registered in our data base as a collection point.

### API

>This API was devoleped using _Typescript_, importing some libraries like **_knex_** for data base connection and Queries execution and express for controllers. It's objective is to make inserts of any coming data from anyone who wants to register their business as a point of collection. So we used _Sqlite3_ as a data base manager, generate 3 tables "items", "points" and "item-points" for storage all this data.
>We constructed routes for controllers and for accessing images(imported by the app in the front-end), and i learned how to work correctly with _Typescript_. 
>Further more i'll work on this project in order to let any one throw you business image on the screen and upload it to my server and have to develop a thank's screen... and keep modifying as a traning for other big projects.

### Controllers

>This is a very simple project, just for learning some skills developing a web application. So using express to build all the back-end we have two types of controllers in this app, Items Controller and points controllers. Starting with the simplest.
